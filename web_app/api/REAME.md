# Train Commander application

Here is the api to select things from database ;)

# Why should I use it ?
Cause it is easier than making query.
The return format is json so you just have to make a call and parse it ;)

# How to I make it run (dev)
- create the database from root connection using the script in `database`.
- go into the `api` folder.
- `node .`
- Your done :)
